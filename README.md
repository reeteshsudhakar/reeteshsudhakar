- Hi! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="20px" height="20px"> My name is <a href="https://reeteshsudhakar.com"><strong>Reetesh Sudhakar</strong></a>. I'm an Associate Engineer at Chicago Trading Company. I completed my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

- Over the past year, I’ve become very interested in the realm of personal finance and how technology plays a role in helping us take charge of our money management on various scales - you'll probably see some stuff on here tinkering with that!
- Outside of academics, I'm into ultimate frisbee, debate, music (specifically, [a cappella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un1HidgVOUk) and choral music), and Formula 1!
